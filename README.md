## Grouper-Scala

### Summary
Grouper is a simple but powerful command-line utility allowing a BootCampSpot instructional specialist to produce balanced student project groups based on GPA in a matter of seconds.
This project is a rewrite of my TypeScript program of the same name, in the interest of learning and exploring Scala programming.
